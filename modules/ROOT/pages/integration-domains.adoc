== On-Premise

=== Definition & Hosting
* Systems or applications hosted within your enterprise’s **own facilities** (data centers or colocation).
* You manage the physical hardware, virtualization layers, network, and OS stack (whether fully bare metal or running a “private cloud” environment).
* Typically provides maximum ownership and control of infrastructure.

=== Networking & Security
* Operates on **internal LAN/WAN**, possibly using DMZ for external access.
* You handle perimeter security, OS patching, identity/access management, and compliance baselines.
* May use virtualization or container orchestration in a “private cloud” style (for elasticity and self-service), but remains dedicated to your organization.

=== Common Use Cases
* **Legacy** or specialized systems requiring direct hardware or older protocols.
* **Modern/Private Cloud** with advanced orchestration but fully under your governance and network domain.
* Internal, high-volume data flows with minimal latency concerns, behind corporate firewalls.

=== Key Points
* Physical location, hardware, and virtualization are under **your** full control.
* Easier to ensure data sovereignty if everything remains on your own premises or private hosting.
* Security model is mostly closed to the outside world unless specifically opened (via DMZ, VPN, etc.).

== Cloud

This domain covers **all externally hosted** environments not fully owned or operated by you. It often breaks down further into Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure/Platform-as-a-Service (IaaS/PaaS), and external partner/government solutions (B2B/B2G).

=== SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)

==== Definition & Hosting
* Vendor-managed applications (CRM, HR, finance, etc.) consumed via subscription.
* No direct control over underlying OS or infrastructure; you configure and use published APIs.

==== Networking & Security
* Primarily over the public internet (HTTPS), possibly with optional VPN tunnels or direct connects.
* Shared responsibility model: the provider secures infrastructure and performs updates; you manage application data usage, user security, and integrations.

==== Common Use Cases
* Rapid deployment of standardized business solutions without heavy operational overhead.
* Integrations with third-party or partner SaaS for real-time collaboration (orders, invoices, marketing campaigns, etc.).

=== IaaS/PaaS (Infrastructure/Platform-as-a-Service)

==== Definition & Hosting
* You rent virtual machines, containers, or application runtimes from a public cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
* **IaaS**: You manage your OS, patches, and app stack on the provider’s compute/storage/network.  
* **PaaS**: You only manage code/data; the provider handles OS and middleware updates.

==== Networking & Security
* Typically use Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) or subnets with controlled ingress/egress.
* Shared responsibility: provider secures physical hardware, hypervisors; you secure your OS (IaaS) or application config (PaaS).
* Often integrated with on-prem networks via VPN or direct connect lines for hybrid scenarios.

==== Common Use Cases
* Custom microservices, event-driven apps, or serverless functions that need global scalability.
* Containerized or ephemeral workloads with flexible resource usage.
* Running third-party software in a public cloud environment while retaining partial OS-level control (IaaS).

=== B2B / B2G (External Partner, Government)

==== Definition & Hosting
* Systems or portals not operated by you, such as business partners, suppliers, customers, or government agencies.
* From your perspective, these endpoints are “external cloud” (if only accessible over the public internet or specialized secure channels).

==== Networking & Security
* Often stricter or specialized protocols (EDI X12, EDIFACT, RosettaNet) or mandatory encryption standards.
* Could include e-invoicing or e-tax submission to a government SaaS portal, or supply chain collaboration with a partner’s on-prem or cloud environment.
* You generally rely on **secure internet endpoints**, partner-defined authentication (certificates, tokens), and standardized message formats.

==== Common Use Cases
* **B2B**: Exchanging purchase orders, invoices, advanced shipping notices with external companies.
* **B2G**: Filing digital tax returns, e-invoicing, customs declarations to government portals.
* Can be merged into “Public Cloud” connections, but many enterprises highlight it separately due to compliance/regulatory overhead.

|===
| Aspect                    | On-Premises (including Private Cloud)                      | Cloud (SaaS / IaaS / PaaS / B2B/B2G)
| Hosting Ownership        | Fully internal or privately dedicated to your org          | Externally managed by a provider, partner, or agency
| Network & Connectivity   | LAN/WAN behind corporate firewalls; optional DMZs or VPN   | Usually over public internet or dedicated links (VPN, direct connect)
| Security                 | You handle all security layers, from physical to OS        | Shared responsibility model; rely partly on external provider or partner’s policies
| Compliance & Data Control| Easiest to enforce local data residency & custom policies  | Must align with provider or partner compliance frameworks, regions, and SLAs
| Integration Patterns     | Could be legacy, file-based, or private APIs; control is local | Typically API-driven, event-driven; often using published vendor endpoints or EDI  
| Use Cases                | Legacy ERP, big data in a private data center, container-based private cloud | SaaS solutions (CRM, HR), custom apps in IaaS/PaaS, external B2B trading, or government e-invoicing

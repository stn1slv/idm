# Integration Domains
:page=toc: right

== Introduction

Integration domains define the deployment and connectivity context in which enterprise integration takes place. The IDM framework categorizes integration domains based on hosting location and directionality of data flow. This abstraction helps architects assess network boundaries, security models, and technology constraints.

The four defined integration domains are:

* Cloud to Cloud
* Cloud to On-Premise
* On-Premise to Cloud
* On-Premise to On-Premise

== 1. Cloud to Cloud

=== Description

Integration between two systems both hosted in cloud environments. Examples include SaaS-to-SaaS, or PaaS services integrating via APIs or events.

=== Characteristics

* Systems reside in public cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Salesforce, Workday).

* Commonly connected via REST APIs, GraphQL, or event brokers.

* Typically exposed over HTTPS, secured with OAuth 2.0 or mTLS.

=== Key Considerations

* Latency: Typically lower due to hyperscaler infrastructure.
* Security: Managed via provider IAM, tokens, rate limiting.
* Observability: Cloud-native logging and tracing platforms can be used.

=== Use Cases

* Integrating HR (Workday) with Identity Providers (Okta).
* Retail platforms syncing product data between Shopify and ERP cloud APIs.

== 2. Cloud to On-Premise

=== Description

An externally hosted system (SaaS, PaaS) connects to an internally hosted system.

=== Characteristics

* Requires ingress into the corporate network.
* Connectivity often enabled via reverse proxy, VPN, or direct interconnect.

=== Key Considerations

* Security: Must enforce perimeter controls, IP allowlists, and possibly TLS termination.
* Network Complexity: Risk of firewall misconfigurations or blocked traffic.
* Governance: Change control for on-prem components can be slower.

=== Use Cases

* Cloud e-commerce solution pulling stock availability from on-prem inventory system.
* External partners triggering updates to on-prem ERP.

== 3. On-Premise to Cloud

=== Description

Internal systems initiate communication with cloud-based endpoints.

=== Characteristics

* Easier to enable than inbound traffic (from cloud to internal).
* Typically routed via proxy/gateway/firewall for egress filtering.

=== Key Considerations

* API Management: May need API key/token management or OAuth client setup.
* Error Handling: Retries and circuit breakers for network variability.
* Data Security: Ensure encryption at rest/in transit when transmitting externally.

=== Use Cases

* On-prem ETL tool pushing data into cloud-based analytics platform.
* Internal applications sending telemetry to cloud observability stacks.

== 4. On-Premise to On-Premise

=== Description

Integration between systems fully contained within the enterprise data center or private cloud.

=== Characteristics

* Entirely under enterprise network perimeter.
* May involve legacy protocols (FTP, JDBC, SOAP) or newer APIs.

=== Key Considerations

* Latency-sensitive: Often used for core transactional flows.
* Legacy Support: Adapters or connectors might be required.
* Governance: Easier to control change and compliance within internal network.

=== Use Cases

* ERP-to-WMS integration in the same facility.
* Scheduled batch jobs syncing databases between business units.

== Guidance for Architects


* Classify integrations early using this domain model to influence deployment, tooling, and security.
* Align domain-specific decisions with integration style (e.g., process vs data vs event-driven).
* Document integration domains in solution blueprints and governance assessments.

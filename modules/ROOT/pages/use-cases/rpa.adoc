== Overview
RPA automates repetitive, routine tasks by simulating human interactions with application interfaces. It is particularly valuable in legacy environments where modern APIs are absent or inadequate.

== Business Scenario
An HR department uses RPA to transfer data from a recruitment system to the payroll system, reducing manual errors and accelerating the onboarding process. In banking, bots can extract data from scanned documents to update core systems.

== Technical Considerations
* **UI-Level Interaction:** Bots mimic keystrokes, mouse clicks, and screen navigation.
* **Task Automation:** Ideal for rule-based, repetitive tasks.
* **Legacy Integration:** Bridges gaps where direct integration is unavailable.
* **Error Handling:** Incorporates logging, monitoring, and escalation for exceptions.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **Security:** Enforces strict controls to secure sensitive data handled by bots.
* **Scalability:** Adjusts bot capacity based on workload.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Reduces manual labor and minimizes errors.
* **Governance:** Provides detailed audit trails for compliance.

== Conclusion
RPA provides a practical solution for automating manual processes, enabling organizations to improve efficiency and accuracy without disrupting legacy systems.

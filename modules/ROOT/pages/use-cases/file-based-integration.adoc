:page-toclevels: 2

== Overview
File-Based Integration is a traditional, yet still relevant, pattern within Cross-Pattern Integration. It handles batch-oriented exchanges of data files, typically when real-time processing is not required.

== Business Scenario
A manufacturing firm might export production schedules as CSV files and import them into another system to update planning. Similarly, a retailer might consolidate daily sales reports via secure file transfers.

== Technical Considerations
* **Batch Processing:** Executes on fixed intervals (hourly, daily, weekly).
* **Standard File Formats:** Commonly uses CSV, XML, or JSON.
* **Secure Transfer Protocols:** Uses FTP, SFTP, or managed file transfer solutions.
* **Automation:** Integrates with scheduling tools to automate file exchanges.
* **Data Validation:** Ensures accuracy through built-in error checking.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **Scalability:** Capable of handling large volumes and file sizes.
* **Security:** Transmits data securely via encryption and secure channels.
* **Data Integrity:** Implements verification and reconciliation processes.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Provides tools for active oversight of transfers.

== Conclusion
File-Based Integration remains a robust approach for batch data transfers, especially suitable for predictable, non-real-time environments.

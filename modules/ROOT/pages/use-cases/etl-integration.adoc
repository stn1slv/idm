:page-toclevels: 2

== Overview
ETL Integration is a cornerstone of Data Integration. It systematically extracts data from source systems, transforms it to meet business and technical requirements, and loads it into target systems such as data warehouses or analytics platforms.

== Business Scenario
A retailer extracts daily sales data from multiple point-of-sale systems, transforms it for consistency, and loads it into a centralized data warehouse. This consolidated data supports comprehensive reporting and informed decision-making.

== Technical Considerations
* **Data Extraction:** Retrieves data from a variety of sources including databases, flat files, and APIs.
* **Transformation:** Cleanses, enriches, and restructures the data according to target schema.
* **Loading:** Supports both bulk and incremental loading strategies.
* **Processing Modes:** Primarily batch-oriented, with some implementations incorporating near-real-time ELT patterns.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **High Throughput:** Processes large volumes of data efficiently.
* **Data Governance:** Ensures compliance with data integrity and regulatory standards.
* **Automation:** Facilitates scheduled, automated workflows.
* **Metadata Management:** Maintains clear data lineage and traceability.

== Conclusion
ETL Integration remains essential for consolidating diverse data sources into a unified analytical framework, providing the foundation for business intelligence and strategic insights.

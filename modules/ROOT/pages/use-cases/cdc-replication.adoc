= Change Data Capture (CDC) Replication
:page=toc: right
:page-toclevels: 2

== Overview
CDC is a Data Integration use-case that captures only the changes (inserts, updates, deletes) occurring in source systems and propagates these to target systems. It enables near-real-time data synchronization with minimal overhead.

== Business Scenario
A bank might use CDC to replicate transaction updates from its core banking system to analytical databases, ensuring management dashboards reflect the latest data.

== Technical Considerations
* Leverages transaction logs to capture data changes.
* Processes only incremental changes, reducing data volume and processing time.
* Minimal impact on source systems.
* Includes monitoring and error handling to ensure data integrity.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **High Availability:** Supports continuous replication.
* **Scalability:** Handles increasing data change volumes.
* **Low Latency:** Minimizes delay between data change and update.
* **Security:** Protects sensitive data throughout the replication process.

== Conclusion
CDC replication is a critical technique for modern enterprises needing real-time or near-real-time data synchronization across systems.

== Overview
API-Managed Integration is a key pattern under Cross-Pattern Integration. It exposes business functions via secure APIs, enabling both internal and external integrations with robust governance and lifecycle management.

== Business Scenario
A retailer might expose an API for real-time product and inventory data, allowing third-party applications or partners to access current information seamlessly. In finance, open banking uses APIs for sharing customer data with authorized services.

== Technical Considerations
* Securely exposes endpoints with OAuth, API keys, and tokenization.
* Incorporates full lifecycle management from creation to deprecation.
* Implements traffic management (rate limiting, throttling).
* Provides analytics and monitoring for API usage.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **High Availability:** Ensures consistent service.
* **Scalability:** Manages variable loads.
* **Security and Compliance:** Meets strict data protection standards.
* **Extensibility:** Adapts to evolving business needs.

== Conclusion
API-Managed Integration offers a flexible and secure framework for exposing core business functionalities, underpinning modern, scalable integration architectures.

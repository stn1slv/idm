== Overview
Streaming Integration is designed for continuous, real-time data flows between systems. It is essential for processing high-velocity data and providing immediate insights.

== Business Scenario
A telecommunications company streams real-time call data and network metrics to monitoring systems for instant analysis, while a financial institution uses live market data feeds for dynamic trading decisions.

== Technical Considerations
* **Continuous Data Flow:** Ingests data as it is generated.
* **High Throughput / Low Latency:** Ensures minimal delay between data generation and processing.
* **Distributed Architecture:** Utilizes message brokers or distributed log systems for scalability.
* **Fault Tolerance:** Implements replication, partitioning, and checkpointing to prevent data loss.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **Horizontal Scalability:** Easily increases capacity by adding resources.
* **Reliable Delivery:** Supports flexible delivery guarantees (e.g., at-least-once or exactly-once semantics).
* **Schema Evolution:** Accommodates changes in data structure.
* **Security and Governance:** Maintains rigorous security and access controls.

== Conclusion
Streaming Integration is vital for applications requiring real-time processing and immediate responses, forming a key part of modern data architectures.

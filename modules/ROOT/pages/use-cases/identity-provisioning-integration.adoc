== Overview
Identity Provisioning Integration automates the synchronization and lifecycle management of user identities and access rights across enterprise systems. It is critical for ensuring up-to-date security and compliance in dynamic organizations.

== Business Scenario
When a new employee is onboarded, the system automatically creates and synchronizes user accounts and access privileges across HR, IT, and internal portals. Likewise, role updates or terminations trigger immediate modifications to system access.

== Technical Considerations
* **Identity Synchronization:** Propagates changes (creation, update, deletion) in near-real-time.
* **Access Rights Management:** Maps roles and permissions according to policies.
* **API/Event-Driven Mechanisms:** Uses API calls or event triggers to initiate provisioning.
* **Policy Enforcement:** Implements business rules such as least-privilege and segregation of duties.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **Robust Auditability:** Provides detailed tracking of identity changes.
* **Secure Communication:** Uses HTTPS, TLS, and digital certificates.
* **Scalability:** Efficiently handles large volumes of identity transactions.
* **Integration with HR/ITSM:** Ensures alignment with core systems of record.

== Conclusion
Identity Provisioning Integration streamlines user lifecycle management, enhancing security and operational efficiency across the enterprise.

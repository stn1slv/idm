== Overview
Data Virtualization provides a unified, real-time view of distributed data without physical replication. It presents an abstraction layer over multiple data sources, enhancing agility and reducing redundancy.

== Business Scenario
A healthcare provider might use data virtualization to allow clinicians to view a consolidated patient record sourced from various departmental databases, thus accelerating access to critical clinical information.

== Technical Considerations
* Enables real-time querying directly from source systems.
* Provides an abstraction layer that unifies disparate data sources.
* Supports federated queries spanning multiple systems.
* Enforces centralized security and governance policies.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **High Performance:** Delivers low-latency access.
* **Scalability:** Adapts to increased data volume and user demands.
* **Flexibility:** Integrates with diverse data types and sources.
* **Ease of Maintenance:** Eliminates the need for physical data movement.

== Conclusion
Data Virtualization is a powerful tool for achieving agile, real-time data access without the complexity of physical data consolidation.

== Overview
IoT Integration connects Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors with enterprise systems, enabling real-time data ingestion and automated responses. This pattern is critical for scenarios such as predictive maintenance and smart operations.

== Business Scenario
A manufacturing facility uses sensor data from production equipment to trigger maintenance alerts before issues occur, while a smart city integrates environmental sensors to optimize traffic flow and public safety responses.

== Technical Considerations
* **Device Connectivity:** Supports protocols like MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, and HTTP.
* **Real-Time Ingestion:** Processes high-frequency data streams with minimal latency.
* **Edge-to-Cloud Processing:** Performs preliminary data processing at the device or edge layer before relaying to central systems.
* **Security and Management:** Implements device authentication, encryption, and centralized configuration.

== Benefits and Core Requirements
* **Low Latency Processing:** Ensures immediate reaction to sensor data.
* **Scalability:** Accommodates a vast number of connected devices.
* **Reliability:** Ensures continuous data availability despite fluctuating network conditions.
* **Compliance:** Meets necessary data security and regulatory standards.

== Conclusion
IoT Integration bridges the physical and digital worlds, delivering real-time insights and automating responses crucial for modern, smart enterprises.

= On-Premise to Cloud Integration Domain
:page-toc: right
:page-toclevels: 2

== Overview

The On-Premise to Cloud domain refers to scenarios where systems hosted in enterprise-controlled data centers or private clouds initiate communication with externally hosted systems in the public cloud. This is a common pattern in hybrid integration landscapes where existing on-premise applications need to interact with SaaS, PaaS, or other cloud-native services.

== Characteristics

* **Initiator**: Internal systems located in corporate data centers or private clouds.
* **Target**: Cloud-based APIs, services, or platforms.
* **Protocols**: REST, SOAP, HTTPS, MQTT, Kafka.
* **Security Mechanisms**: Outbound firewalls, OAuth 2.0 clients, TLS, client certificates.
* **Network Path**: Traffic flows from internal network to external internet or via dedicated connections (VPN, Direct Connect, ExpressRoute).

== Common Use Cases

* ERP systems pushing purchase orders to a cloud-based procurement portal.
* Core banking systems sending customer updates to a CRM like Salesforce.
* On-prem log aggregators streaming events to cloud observability platforms.
* Batch jobs publishing data to public cloud storage or analytics engines.

== Integration Styles & Patterns

* **API-Managed Integration**: On-prem systems act as clients consuming public APIs.
* **Data Integration**: Scheduled exports of CSV/JSON to cloud storage buckets.
* **Event-Based Integration**: Internal publishers pushing to cloud-managed Kafka or MQTT brokers.

== Security Considerations

* Enforce outbound firewall rules to allow only intended cloud destinations.
* Use secure authentication methods (client credentials, mutual TLS).
* Implement API throttling and retries for unstable network links.
* Ensure token storage and refresh are handled securely on-prem.

== Governance Guidance

* **Asset Classification**: Define and catalog all on-prem systems accessing cloud.
* **Change Management**: Coordinate changes between internal and cloud teams.
* **Auditability**: Centralize logging of all external calls from on-prem.

== Observability & NFRs

* Enable outbound tracing from on-premise services to cloud APIs.
* Monitor retry rates, latency, and HTTP status codes.
* Set SLAs for outbound availability and resilience.

== Best Practices

* Use API Gateway as a secure bridge between on-prem and cloud APIs.
* Decouple systems using queues or topics to avoid tight coupling.
* Prefer stateless designs to avoid maintaining session context across domains.
* Align data retention and encryption policies with cloud provider requirements.

== Template Artifacts

* Outbound API call specification template
* Proxy configuration checklist (TLS, DNS, ports)
* Confluence page template for on-prem to cloud use-case documentation
* Retry/backoff policy guideline document

== Example Blueprint

=== Scenario: On-Prem ERP → Salesforce

* **Purpose**: Sync customer master data to Salesforce CRM.
* **Initiation**: On-prem SAP system sends HTTP POST to Salesforce API.
* **Security**: OAuth 2.0 with certificate-based client authentication.
* **Technology Stack**: SAP PO → Mulesoft → Salesforce.
* **Monitoring**: Logs collected on-prem and forwarded to Azure Monitor.

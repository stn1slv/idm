= On-Premise to On-Premise Integration Domain
:page-toc: right
:page-toclevels: 2

== Overview

The On-Premise to On-Premise domain covers integrations between systems fully hosted within enterprise-controlled data centers or private cloud environments. These integrations often involve legacy systems and high-performance internal transactions, and typically benefit from lower latency and full infrastructure control.

== Characteristics

* **Deployment Location**: Both systems reside inside corporate-managed environments.
* **Common Technologies**: ESBs, message brokers, file transfers, SOAP/REST APIs.
* **Protocols**: SOAP, REST, JDBC, JMS, FTP/SFTP, proprietary connectors.
* **Security Mechanisms**: Internal IAM, network-level firewalls, VPN segmentation.
* **Latency Profile**: Very low; systems typically connected via LAN or private WAN.
* **Availability**: Often part of mission-critical infrastructure with HA/DR setups.

== Common Use Cases

* ERP and warehouse management systems (WMS) exchanging stock and fulfillment data.
* Batch synchronization between finance (SAP) and reporting systems.
* File-based exchanges between legacy CRM and billing systems.
* Integration between HR systems and corporate directories (e.g., AD, LDAP).

== Integration Styles & Patterns

* **Process Integration**: Message-based orchestration of real-time or near-real-time processes.
* **File-Based Integration**: For legacy batch scenarios or when APIs are unavailable.
* **Workflow Automation**: Cross-system orchestration using BPM or orchestration engines.
* **Master Data Synchronization**: Core data entity alignment (e.g., products, customers).

== Security Considerations

* Rely on internal firewalls and VLAN segmentation.
* Apply least-privilege access to message queues, file shares, and services.
* Secure service-to-service calls with internal CA-signed certificates.
* Monitor privileged user access and admin actions.

== Governance Guidance

* **Change Management**: Align with CAB/ITSM processes for production releases.
* **Version Control**: Maintain integration logic in source control (e.g., Git).
* **Configuration Management**: Centralize runtime properties via vaults or config servers.
* **Documentation**: Catalog each integration with system owners, contact points, and dependencies.

== Observability & NFRs

* Monitor message queues and integration runtimes.
* Track SLA violations, batch completion rates, and message loss.
* Implement alerting for failed file transfers, API timeouts, or DB connection drops.
* Ensure DR failover mechanisms are tested and validated.

== Best Practices

* Use message correlation IDs for traceability.
* Decouple integrations using pub/sub or intermediate stores.
* Reuse transformation mappings and canonical models.
* Build test automation around integration endpoints and edge cases.

== Template Artifacts

* Interface specification template (REST/SOAP)
* Message mapping sheets (XLS or JSON Schema)
* Deployment checklist for secured internal services
* Confluence template for documenting legacy-to-legacy interfaces

== Example Blueprint

=== Scenario: SAP ECC â†” Warehouse Management System

* **Purpose**: Sync stock movements and goods receipts.
* **Initiation**: SAP triggers IDoc messages to WMS queue.
* **Security**: VPN-segmented VLAN, SAP-certified adapter.
* **Technology Stack**: SAP PI/PO, IBM MQ, Java microservice for transformation.
* **Monitoring**: Logs shipped to ELK stack; functional errors auto-reported via email.

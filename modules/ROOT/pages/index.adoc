= Introduction to Integration Development Method
:page=toc: right
:page-toclevels: 3

== Purpose
The Integration Development Method (IDM) provides integration professionals, solution architects, and enterprise teams with a hands-on, technology-neutral framework for designing, implementing, and governing integration solutions across complex enterprise landscapes.

Inspired by SAP’s ISA-M, IDM significantly expands and refines the approach by focusing on modern integration demands — including cloud-native, hybrid, and B2B/B2G use cases — and aligning with TOGAF principles for enterprise architecture.

== Vision and Goals
IDM aims to:

* Deliver a structured and prescriptive method for integration development

* Support enterprise-grade use cases across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid landscapes

* Enable alignment with TOGAF’s Architecture Development Method (ADM)

* Provide actionable templates, examples, and checklists to accelerate delivery

* Promote governance, consistency, and security in integration architecture

== Target Audience
IDM is intended for:

* Integration and Solution Architects

* Enterprise Architects

* Integration Developers and Platform Engineers

* Architecture Governance and COE teams

== Alignment with TOGAF
IDM complements TOGAF by providing concrete integration guidance within the ADM cycle:

|===
| TOGAF ADM Phase | IDM Contribution

| Preliminary / A | Define integration principles and assess integration maturity
| B / C / D       | Design integration architecture, classify use cases and patterns
| E / F           | Map integration initiatives into solution plans and roadmaps
| G / H           | Govern, monitor, and evolve integration implementations

== Method Blocks
IDM consists of eight core building blocks:

image:overview.svg[]

. Integration Domains – Classify the hosting context (on-premises, cloud, B2B/B2G)
. Integration Styles & Use Cases – Identify the nature and type of integration
. Integration Principles – Define key architectural guidelines
. Integration Technology Mapping – Map integration styles to capabilities and tools
. Integration Blueprint – Create prescriptive architecture templates and solution diagrams
. Technology Blueprint – Detail technology-agnostic infrastructure components
. Integration Protocols, Data Formats & API Specifications – Define interface and communication standards
. Data Security – Address integration-specific security, compliance, and access concerns

== Delivery Format
IDM is delivered as a modular, wiki-based framework (e.g., Confluence or Antora), supported by:

* Page templates and documentation guidelines

* Visual diagrams and reference architectures

* Checklists and design reviews

* Pattern libraries and example use cases

== Getting Started
Begin by:

. Identifying applicable Integration Domains in your landscape
. Classifying integration scenarios using Integration Styles & Use Cases
. Applying relevant Integration Principles and selecting suitable patterns
. Referencing the Integration Blueprint and tailoring solution designs
. Embedding governance and security considerations from the outset

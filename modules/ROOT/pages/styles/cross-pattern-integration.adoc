== Purpose
Cross‑Pattern Integration (CPI) unifies **process‑centric and data‑centric techniques** to solve complex, multi‑modal integration scenarios. It supports real‑time orchestration, continuous data flows, API exposure, event streaming, RPA, IoT, and legacy file transfer within a single cohesive approach.

== Alignment with IDM & TOGAF
*IDM Block*: *Integration Styles & Use Cases* → *Cross‑Pattern Integration*  ⟶ bridges *Integration Principles*, *Technology Mapping*, and *Blueprints*.

*TOGAF*: CPI designs often span **ADM Phases B–D** (Business, Application, Data, Technology) and require strong governance in Phases F–G because they cut across multiple architecture layers.

== When to Use Cross‑Pattern Integration
* A single initiative requires **both transactional orchestration and bulk/stream data movement** (e.g., order fulfillment that triggers analytics in real time).
* You must expose APIs while simultaneously emitting events and persisting data to a lake.
* Integrations involve **heterogeneous interaction modes** (APIs, events, files, RPA bots, device telemetry).
* Need for agility: ability to switch or combine patterns quickly as requirements evolve.

=== Typical Integration Domains
[cols="25,75"]
|===
|Domain |Example Scenarios
|Hybrid Cloud | e‑commerce checkout (real‑time API) + analytics stream to cloud data platform
|B2B / Partner | Supplier API calls + nightly EDI file + event notifications
|IoT & Edge    | Device telemetry (stream) + command/response API + batch firmware logs upload
|Legacy Modernisation | RPA screen scrape feeding API gateway and data pipeline
|===

== Core Capabilities & Patterns
=== Hybrid Integration Approach
Blend process orchestration (BPM, ESB) with data pipelines (ETL/streaming) under common governance.

=== API Management
Expose and secure business capabilities; manage versioning and developer onboarding.

=== Event‑Driven Architecture (EDA)
Publish/subscribe or event streaming for asynchronous propagation and decoupling.

=== Streaming Data Processing
Low‑latency, high‑throughput pipelines using distributed streaming frameworks.

=== File‑Based Integration
Batch file exchange when systems cannot support API/event methods (often part of initial migration).

=== Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Automated UI interactions to bridge gaps until APIs or proper connectors are available.

=== IoT Connectivity
Edge‑to‑cloud ingestion, device management, and command patterns.

== Non‑Functional Considerations
[horizontal]
Latency:: Varies per sub‑pattern; document per interaction (API ≤ 2 s, event ≤ 1 s, file 1×/day etc.).
Throughput:: Aggregate across modes; plan broker/file servers for worst peaks.
Flexibility:: Ability to add/remove consumers without code changes (EDA, API gateway abstraction).
Security:: Unified authZ/authN (OAuth, mutual TLS, VPN) across APIs, events, files.
Observability:: Correlate transactions spanning modes (trace‑id propagated across REST, Kafka, batch job IDs).
Cost Optimisation:: Evaluate TCO when combining real‑time and batch (broker retention, storage, RPA licences).

== Governance & Lifecycle
. *Pattern Decomposition* – identify sub‑patterns (API, EDA, Batch) per business requirement.
. *Capability Alignment* – map each sub‑pattern to HIP capabilities (API gateway, event broker, ETL engine).
. *Design Authority Review* – ensure combined solution meets global NFRs and security.
. *Implementation* – reuse common integration libraries; avoid duplicate mapping logic.
. *Testing* – integrated test plan covering API tests, event replay, batch reconciliation.
. *Deployment* – orchestrate multi‑component release (CI/CD pipelines with dependency ordering).
. *Operate & Monitor* – central dashboard aggregating API metrics, broker lag, file transfer status, RPA bot health.
. *Evolve* – retire legacy mode (e.g., file) when modern pattern (API/event) is fully adopted.

== Design Checklist
* [ ] Sub‑patterns identified and documented.
* [ ] Data contracts (API spec, event schema, file layout) versioned.
* [ ] Unified security model across all interaction modes.
* [ ] End‑to‑end traceability (shared correlation IDs / lineage mappings).
* [ ] NFRs consolidated; conflict resolution documented (e.g., performance vs cost).
* [ ] Governance artefacts stored with clear ownership per sub‑pattern.

== Conclusion
Cross‑Pattern Integration delivers the **versatility and agility** required for digital business initiatives that cannot be met by a single style alone. By systematically decomposing needs, applying the right sub‑patterns, and governing them under IDM, enterprises can create cohesive, future‑proof integration solutions.

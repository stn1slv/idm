== Introduction
Process Integration focuses on real-time, message-based interactions that orchestrate complex business processes. It ensures transactional integrity and rapid data exchanges across connected systems.

== Specific Characteristics and Requirements

=== Transactional Integrity
Guarantees that business transactions execute fully or not at all through atomic operations and robust error handling.

=== Reliable Messaging
Ensures messages are delivered once and in order by using persistent queues, acknowledgments, and error tracking.

=== Message Orchestration
Coordinates multi-system interactions by sequencing tasks, managing conditional logic, and handling exceptions.

=== B2B Protocol Support
Supports standard protocols (EDI, XML, RESTful web services) for secure external system communication.

=== API-Centric Communication
Utilizes both synchronous and asynchronous APIs to enable standardized and scalable connectivity.

=== Real-Time Processing
Maintains immediate data exchange to ensure that all systems are kept up to date for dynamic operations.

=== Pre-Packaged Integration Content
Often includes adapters, connectors, and mapping templates to accelerate implementation for common enterprise applications.

== Conclusion
Process Integration is a cornerstone for modern enterprise architecture, delivering reliable, real-time connectivity that drives efficient business operations.

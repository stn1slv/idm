== Introduction
Data Integration focuses on the efficient movement, transformation, and consolidation of data across various systems. It underpins analytics, reporting, and enterprise data consistency.

== Specific Characteristics and Requirements

=== Data Orchestration
Coordinates multiple data tasks—extraction, transformation, and loading—to streamline complex data processes.

=== Complex Transformations
Converts and enriches raw data to match target formats through aggregation, cleaning, and restructuring.

=== Data Quality Management
Ensures data accuracy and consistency via deduplication, validation, cleansing, and standardization processes.

=== Big Data Processing
Accommodates high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data using distributed systems and NoSQL databases.

=== High-Throughput Processing
Processes large data volumes efficiently using parallel processing and distributed streaming solutions.

=== API and Middleware Driven Integration
Facilitates standardized interactions across heterogeneous data sources through APIs and middleware technologies.

=== Batch and Real-Time Capabilities
Supports both scheduled, batch-driven ETL operations and near-real-time synchronization (e.g., via CDC).

== Conclusion
Data Integration is critical for transforming and consolidating data into actionable insights. It supports both traditional batch processing and modern continuous data flows.
